Current Phase: phase-2

Remember that the basic idea for this project is in prompting/idea.md, the spec is in prompting/<phase>/spec.md and the prompt plan, which serves as the implementation plan is in prompting/<phase>/prompt_plan.md. Always read these files to get a good idea about how the implementation is to be carried out. Once a step has been implemented, always mark it as done in the prompting/<phase>/todo.md file.

Api details are in prompting/phase-1/api-details.md so please make use of it to ensure we are hitting the correct api and response is as expected and we have access to our API.

Have a test script to make sure we have everything in place for the development.

I will be setting up the base project structure with `uv`. So learn how to use it. I will create .env with FOOTBALL_API_KEY.

Add .env to .gitignore
